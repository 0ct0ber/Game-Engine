# Game-Engine
This is the first simple game in Java I made. I planned to turn it into a game engine, but I'm probably just going to rewrite it altogether.

# Gameplay

When the game starts, you control a ship with the left and right arrow keys, and fire using spacebar. Try and destroy all of the asteroids before they crash into you.
